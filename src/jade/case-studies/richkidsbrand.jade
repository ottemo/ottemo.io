                    | Like all ambitious and innovative brands, Rich Kids recognized room for improvements to better serve its customers. They opted to confront them head-on and dramatically transform their customers' digital experience.
                    | A slow, unreliable catalog and website publishing system diminished their ability to run daily operations, requiring hours of costly troubleshooting. Painful and tedious deployment processes and less than ideal code base hindered IT teams’ ability to innovate. Rich Kids was unable to upgrade their antiquated ATG platform due to its inflexible customizations and overall complexity.
                    | Operational costs soared as Rich Kids struggled with managing infrastructure and maintaining security standards through PCI compliance. Finally, a problematic mobile app required duplicate investments to generate content and leverage catalog data.
